📏 This is a MathQuiz website, built for CS50 Final Project

📏 I am in charge in website's Backend service [Frontend is built by https://github.com/khoph0312]

📏 We tried using AWS Services, such as EC2, Lambda, RDS, IAM - We ended up paying USD 70+ for Database service and we quit using it (Great Experience tho 🥲)

📏 We end up using localhost server, with XAMPP, Apache to connect MySQL server
